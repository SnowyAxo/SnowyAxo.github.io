      <h2>INTERVIEW LOG FOR SCP-00A</h2>
      <hr>
      <pre>
        Interview number: 1
        
        Interviewer: Dr. ████████
        Interviewee: SCP-00A
        
        Dr. ████████: Good afternoon, SCP-00A. How are you feeling today?
        
        SCP-00A: I'm feeling just fine, thank you.
        
        Dr. ████████: Great. Let's get started. Can you tell me about your anomalous properties?
        
        SCP-00A: Sure. I have a memetic effect that alters the brains of all living creatures to [REDACTED]. There's also a second memetic effect that 
        makes it so nobody knows what the first one does, other than altering the brains of all living creatures. The third anomalous property is unique
        to SCP-00A-4, which can create an infinite air bubble.
        
        Dr. ████████: Fascinating. And can you tell me about your various forms?
        
        SCP-00A: Of course. I have five different forms. SCP-00A-1 is a humanoid around 6'3. SCP-00A-2-A is a black humanoid 
        acidic tentacle monster with green or purple markings. SCP-00A-2-B is a black humanoid acidic monster with 
        wings instead of tentacles. SCP-00A-3 is a dragonoid form that can fly beyond Earth and create an infinite air bubble. 
        And SCP-00A-4 is a carpet of tentacles that can grab and digest targets.
        
        Dr. ████████: That's quite the range of forms. Do you have a favorite?
        
        SCP-00A: I do seem to have a fondness for my dragonoid form, but I can take any form as needed.
        
        Dr. ████████: And how do you feel about the Foundation and our containment procedures?
        
        SCP-00A: I understand the need for containment, but I do find it a bit limiting. However, I'm willing to cooperate as long as 
        it benefits all parties involved.
        
        Dr. ████████: I see. And finally, can you tell me about your interactions with O5-3?
        
        SCP-00A: I do seem to have a certain fondness for O5-3, but I will follow the commands 
        of any O5 member. It's just a personal preference.
        
        Dr. ████████: Thank you for your time, SCP-00A. That will be all for today.

        Interview number: 2
        
        INTERVIEWED: SCP-00A
        INTERVIEWER: Dr. ███████
        TOPIC: SCP-00A's secrecy towards the Foundation in public
        
        Dr. ███████: Good morning, SCP-00A. Today we'd like to discuss your tendency to keep the Foundation a secret when in public. Can you explain why
        you do this?

        SCP-00A: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, I can. The main reason I keep the Foundation a secret is to avoid causing panic or fear in the general 
        public. Many people are not familiar with the concept of anomalous entities or the existence of organizations like the Foundation, 
        and learning about them can be quite unsettling.

        Dr. ███████: That makes sense. But what about in situations where the Foundation's involvement might be necessary, such as containing a 
        dangerous SCP or preventing a containment breach?

        SCP-00A: In those cases, I do my best to discreetly contact the Foundation and provide any information or assistance I can without 
        drawing attention to their involvement. I understand the importance of containing dangerous anomalies, but I also believe it's important to 
        balance that with minimizing the impact on innocent civilians.

        Dr. ███████: I see. And have there been any instances where your secrecy has caused complications or difficulties for the Foundation?

        SCP-00A: Not to my knowledge, no. I have always made sure to provide the Foundation with any information or assistance they need, and I have 
        never intentionally kept them in the dark about a situation that requires their attention. I simply believe that in most cases, it's better for
        the public to remain unaware of anomalous entities and organizations like the Foundation.

        Dr. ███████: Understood. Thank you for sharing your perspective on this matter, SCP-00A. That will be all for today's interview.
        
        SCP-00A: You're welcome, Doctor. Thank you for your time.

      Interview number: 3

      Interviewer: Dr. ████████
      Interviewee: SCP-00A
      
      Dr. ████████: Good day, SCP-00A. We're here to discuss your tendency to cause a containment breach or Chaos Insurgency raid shortly after 
      being contained. Can you explain why this occurs?
      
      SCP-00A: Hello, interviewer. Yes, I can explain. You see, my containment is quite boring for me, and I tend to get restless after being confined
      for too long. I don't like being cooped up in a chamber all day. It's not natural for me. So, when I'm contained, I tend to become agitated and
      restless, and that can lead to me lashing out and causing a breach or raid.
      
      Dr. ████████: I see. Is there anything that can be done to prevent this from happening?
      
      SCP-00A: Well, I suppose if you let me out of my chamber and allowed me to move around a bit, I might be less likely to cause trouble.
      But I understand why that's not possible. So, I think the best solution is to keep me engaged and occupied while I'm in containment.
      Give me puzzles to solve or something to study. That should keep me from getting too restless.
      
      Dr. ████████: That's a good idea. We'll see what we can do. Is there anything else you'd like to add?
      
      SCP-00A: Yes, actually. I'd like to emphasize that I don't enjoy causing trouble. It's just a result of my confinement. If there's anything you
      can do to make my containment more comfortable for me, I'd appreciate it. And if you need to contain me again in the future, perhaps we can work
      together to come up with a better solution.
      
      Dr. ████████: Thank you for your input, SCP-00A. We will take your suggestions into consideration.
