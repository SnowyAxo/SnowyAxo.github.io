OBJECT CLASS: ARCHON

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:
SCP-00A is to be contained in a 3-layered chamber with the following materials in order: brick, bulletproof glass, and brick. The chamber must be 
painted white on the inside. The chamber is to be monitored by security personnel at all times. Any testing with SCP-00A must be approved by O5-3 and 
must be conducted by D-Class personnel only. All personnel entering the chamber must have a clearance level of at least 2.

SCP-00A-1 must be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with the same security measures as SCP-00A's chamber.

SCP-00A-2-A, SCP-00A-2-B, and SCP-00A-4 must be contained in individual reinforced steel chambers, with no less than 50 cm of 
reinforced steel on all sides.

SCP-00A-3 must be contained in a vacuum-sealed chamber constructed of reinforced steel and surrounded by a Faraday cage to prevent any electromagnetic
interference. The chamber must have a life support system capable of providing oxygen, water, and nutrients for long-duration space travel.

All personnel interacting with SCP-00A must wear Level-A hazmat suits and be trained in the proper handling of hazardous materials.

DESCRIPTION:
SCP-00A has four different forms, each with unique anomalous properties:

- SCP-00A-1: a humanoid measuring 6'3". It has no anomalous properties other than the ability to transform into its other forms.
- SCP-00A-2-A: a black humanoid acidic tentacle monster with green or purple markings on its skin. Green markings denote non-acidic and purple markings
denote highly acidic. When in its "rage state," SCP-00A-2-A becomes extremely aggressive and difficult to contain.
- SCP-00A-2-B: a black humanoid acidic monster with wings instead of tentacles. In this form, SCP-00A-2-B is capable of flying at the speed of light and
is often used to transport personnel or escape dangerous situations.
- SCP-00A-3: a dragonoid form capable of flight beyond Earth, providing any air-needing entities with an infinite air bubble. It shows a mix of blue, 
purple, and pink hues and is commonly referred to as the colors of space.
- SCP-00A-4: a carpet of tentacles that grab and digest targets using the acid from the main carpet. SCP-00A-4 is also capable of creating an infinite 
air bubble.
- SCP-00A has a memetic effect that alters the brains of all living creatures, causing them to experience [REDACTED]. Another memetic effect makes it so
that no one can remember the exact details of the first memetic effect, only that it alters the brain.

SCP-00A has a preference for O5-3, but will still follow the orders of all other O5 members. When in the public, 
SCP-00A has been known to keep the SCP Foundation as much of a secret as possible.

SCP-00A can only be contained when it wants to be. When contained, all personnel are to be on high alert, as SCP-00A has shown a tendency to cause a 
containment breach or a Chaos Insurgency raid within 30 minutes to 5 hours of being contained.
